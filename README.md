# Dicio assistant

Dicio is an open source (voice) assistant running on Android. It supports many different skills and input/output methods, and it provides both speech and graphical feedback to a question. Open to contributors :-D

## Skills

- search: look up information on Qwant (e.g. "Search for Dicio")
- weather: collects weather information from OpenWeatherMap (e.g. "What's the weather like?")
- lyrics: shows Genius lyrics for songs (e.g. "What's the song that goes we will we will rock you?")
